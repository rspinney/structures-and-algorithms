# structures-and-algorithms

Personal project to catalogue a broad range of data structures and associated algorithms, through hand-rolled implementations, using smart pointers and perfect forwarding.

This code is ***not*** intended for real world use, but for education purposes only.

Build with:

``mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make``
